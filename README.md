# SchoolShare DSS

A Decision Support System for reducing geographic inequality through public-private infrastructure sharing.

**Live Demo:** [schoolsharedss.org](http://schoolsharedss.org)

## Overview

SchoolShare DSS helps policymakers and grant makers identify optimal locations for expanding access to healthcare and cultural services by leveraging existing public school infrastructure. The tool visualizes optimization results that show how school-based partnerships can reduce geographic inequality in service access.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Analysis**: Select state, service type (arts/hospitals), and school activation rate
- **Equity Impact Metrics**: Distance reductions, coverage improvements, demographic breakdowns
- **Geographic Visualization**: Choropleth maps showing improvement by census block group
- **Implementation Planning**: Cost estimates, funding sources, school lists for download

## Research

This tool is based on research presented in:
